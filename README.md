## Download From GitHub
### 1. Download as zip
Go 'Code' -> 'Download as Zip'. Download and extract to folder wherever you want.

### 2. Go to Chrome Extension Settings
Click on the three dots in the top left of chrome window. Then go 'More tools' -> 'Extensions'.

### 3. Unpack/Pack Extension
Enter developer mode (top left switch) and click on 'Pack Extension' and select the extracted code folder you just downloaded. You will get two files from Chrome that will save in the directory where the code folder is saved (not in the code folder). Keep these files in a safe place (can leave them in their original position).
Now click on 'Load unpacked' and select the same folder as before. The extension should load and be available, pin the extension on your chrome so you can easily click on the icon (optional)

If you wish to change the settings click on the 'Details' button in the extension settings for the extension and then click on 'Extension Options' where you can change the day of pickup and override the next bin if it doesn't align with your schedule.
